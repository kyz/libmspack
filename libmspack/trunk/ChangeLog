	* many files: Made the code compile with C++
	- Renamed all 'this' variables/parameters to 'self'
	- Added casts to all memory allocations.
	- Added extern "C" to header files with extern declarations.
	- Made system.c include system.h.
	- Changed the K&R-style headers to ANSI-style headers in md5.c

2010-08-04:  Stuart Caie <kyzer@4u.net>

	* many files: removed unnecessary <unistd.h> include

2010-07-19:  Stuart Caie <kyzer@4u.net>

	* cabd_md5.c, chmd_md5.c: Replace writing files to disk then
	MD5summing them, with an MD5summer built into mspack_system.
	Much, much faster results.

	* qtmd_decompress(): Robert Riebisch pointed out a Quantum
	data integrity check that could never be tripped, because
	frame_todo is unsigned, so it will never be decremented
	below zero. Replaced the check with one that assumes that
	decrementing past zero wraps frame_todo round to a number
	more than its maximum value (QTM_FRAME_SIZE).

2010-07-18:  Stuart Caie <kyzer@4u.net>

	* cabd.c: Special logic to pass cabd_sys_read() errors back
	to cabd_extract() wasn't compatible with the decompressor
	logic of returning the same error repeatedly once unpacking
	fails. This meant that if decompressing failed because of
	a read error, then the next file in the same folder would
	come back as "no error", but the decompressed wouldn't have
	even attempted to decompress the file. Added a new state
	variable, read_error, with the same lifespan as a decompressor,
	to pass the underlying reason for MSPACK_ERR_READ errors back.

	* mszipd.c: improve MS-ZIP recovery by saving all the bytes
	decoded prior to a block failing. This requires remembering
	how far we got through the block, so the code has been made
	slightly slower (about 0.003 seconds slower per gigabyte
	unpacked) by removing the local variable window_posn
	and keeping it in the state structure instead.

2010-07-16:  Stuart Caie <kyzer@4u.net>

	* Makefile.am: strange interactions. When -std=c99 is used,
	my Ubuntu's <stdio.h> (libc6-dev 2.11.1-0ubuntu7.2) does NOT
	define fseeko() unless _LARGEFILE_SOURCE is also defined. But
	configure always uses -std=gnu99, not -std=c99, so its test
	determines _LARGEFILE_SOURCE isn't needed but HAVE_FSEEKO is
	true. The implicit fseeko definition has a 32-bit rather than
	64-bit offset, which means the mode parameter is interpreted
	as part of the offset, and the mode is taken from the stack,
	which is generally 0 (SEEK_SET). This breaks all SEEK_CURs.
	The code works fine when -std=c99 is not set, so just remove
	it for the time being.

2010-07-12:  Stuart Caie <kyzer@4u.net>

	* system.c: Reject reading/writing a negative number of bytes.

	* chmd.c: allow zero-length files to be seen. Previously they were
	skipped because they were mistaken for directory entries.

2010-07-08:  Stuart Caie <kyzer@4u.net>

	* qtmd.c: Larry Frieson found an important bug in the Quantum
	decoder. Window wraps flush all unwritten data to disk.
	However, sometimes less data is needed, which makes
	out_bytes negative, which is then passed to write(). Some
	write() implementations treat negative sizes it as a large
	positive integer and segfault trying to write the buffer.

	* Makefile.am, test/*.c: fixed automake file so that the
	package passes a "make distcheck".

2010-07-07:  Stuart Caie <kyzer@4u.net>

	* doc/szdd_kwaj_format.html: explain SZDD/KWAJ file format.

	* lzssd.c: fixed SZDD decompression bugs.

	* test/chmd_compare: Add scripts for comparing chmd_md5 against
	Microsoft's own code.

	* test/chmd_md5.c: remove the need to decompress everything
	twice, as this is already in chmx.c if needed.

2010-07-06:  Stuart Caie <kyzer@4u.net>

	* many files: added SZDD and KWAJ decompression support.

2010-06-18:  Stuart Caie  <kyzer@4u.net>

	* system.h: expanded the test for 64-bit largefile support so
	it also works on 64-bit native operating systems where you
	don't have to define _FILE_OFFSET_BITS.

2010-06-17:  Stuart Caie <kyzer@4u.net>

	* libmspack.pc.in: Added pkg-config support. Thanks to
	Patrice Dumas for the patch.

2010-06-14:  Stuart Caie <kyzer@4u.net>

	* qtmd.c, lzxd.c, mszipd.c: created new headers, readbits.h and
	readhuff.h, which bundle up the bit-reading and huffman-reading
	code found in the MSZIP, LZX and Quantum decoders.

2010-06-11:  Stuart Caie <kyzer@4u.net>

	* qtmd_static_init(): Removed function in favour of static const
	tables, same rationale as for lzxd_static_init().

	* qtmd_read_input(), zipd_read_input(): After testing against my
	set of CABs from the wild, I've found both these functions _need_
	an extra EOF flag, like lzxd_read_input() has. So I've added
	it. This means CABs get decoded properly AND there's no reading
	fictional bytes.

2010-06-03:  Stuart Caie  <kyzer@4u.net>

	* test/cabd_md5.c: updated this so it has better output and
	doesn't need to be in the same directory as the files for multi-
	part sets.

2010-05-20:  Stuart Caie  <kyzer@4u.net>

	* qtmd_read_input(), zipd_read_input(): Both these functions are
	essentially copies of lzxd_read_input(), but that has a feature
	they don't have - an extra EOF flag. So if EOF is
	encountered (sys->read() returns 0 bytes), these don't pass on the
	error. Their respective bit-reading functions that called them
	then go on to access at least one byte of the input buffer, which
	doesn't exist as sys->read() returned 0. Thanks to Michael
	Vidrevich for spotting this and providing a test case.

2010-05-20:  Stuart Caie  <kyzer@4u.net>

	* system.h: It turns out no configure.ac tests are needed to
	decide between __func__ and __FUNCTION__, so I put the standard
	one (__func__) back into the D() macro, along with some
	special-case ifdefs for old versions of GCC.

	* lzxd_static_init(): Removed function in favour of static const
	tables.  Jorge Lodos thinks it causes multithreading problems, I
	disagree. However, there are speed benefits to declaring the
	tables as static const.

	* cabd_init_decomp(): Fixed code which never runs but would write
	to a null pointer if it could. Changed it to an assert() as it
	will only trip if someone rewrites the internals of cabd.c. Thanks
	to Jorge Lodos for finding it.

	* inflate(): Fixed an off-by-one error: if the LITERAL table
	emitted code 286, this would read one byte past the end of
	lit_extrabits[]. Thanks to Jorge Lodos for finding it.

2010-05-06:  Stuart Caie  <kyzer@4u.net>

	* test/cabrip.c, test/chminfo.c: add fseeko() support

2009-06-01:  Stuart Caie   <kyzer@4u.net>

	* README: clarify the extended license terms

	* doc, Makefile.am: make the doxygen makefile work when using
	an alternate build directory

2006-09-20:  Stuart Caie   <kyzer@4u.net>

	* system.h: I had a choice of adding more to configure.ac to
	test for __func__ and __FUNCTION__, or just removing __FUNCTION__
	from the D() macro. I chose the latter.

	* Makefile.am: Now the --enable-debug in configure will actually
	apply -DDEBUG to the sources.

2006-09-20:  Stuart Caie   <kyzer@4u.net>

	* qtmd_decompress(): Fixed a major bug in the QTM decoder, as
	reported by Tomasz Kojm last year. Removed the restriction on
	window sizes as a result. Correctly decodes the XLVIEW cabinets.

2006-08-31:  Stuart Caie   <kyzer@4u.net>

	* lzxd_decompress(): Two major bugs fixed. Firstly, the R0/R1/R2
	local variables weren't set to 1 after lzxd_reset_state().
	Secondly, the LZX decompression stream can sometimes become
	odd-aligned (after an uncompressed block) and the next 16 bit
	fetch needs to be split across two input buffers, ENSURE_BITS()
	didn't cover this case. Many thanks to Igor Glucksmann for
	discovering both these bugs.

2005-06-30:  Stuart Caie   <kyzer@4u.net>

	* cabd_search(): fixed problems with searching files > 4GB for
	cabinets.

2005-06-23:  Stuart Caie   <kyzer@4u.net>

	* qtmd_init(): The QTM decoder is broken for QTM streams with a
	window size less than the frame size. Until this is fixed, fail
	to initialise QTM window sizes less than 15. Thanks to Tomasz Kojm
	for finding the bug.

2005-03-22:  Stuart Caie   <kyzer@4u.net>

	* system.h: now undefs "read", as the latest glibc defines read()
	as a macro which messes everything up. Thanks to Ville Skyttä for
	the update.

2005-03-14:  Stuart Caie   <kyzer@4u.net>

	* test/multifh.c: write an mspack_system implementation that can
	handle normal disk files, open file handles, open file descriptors
	and raw memory all at the same time.

2005-02-24:  Stuart Caie   <kyzer@4u.net>

	* chmd_read_headers(): avoid infinite loop when chmhs1_ChunkSize is
	zero. Thanks to Serge Semashko for the research and discovery.

2005-02-18:  Stuart Caie   <kyzer@4u.net>

	* mspack.h: renamed the "interface" parameter of mspack_version() to
	"entity", as interface is a reserved word in C++. Thanks to Yuriy Z
	for the discovery.

2004-12-09:  Stuart Caie   <kyzer@4u.net>

	* lzss.h, szdd.h, szddd.h: more work on the SZDD/LZSS design.
	
2004-06-12:  Stuart Caie   <kyzer@4u.net>

	* lzxd_static_init(): removed write to lzxd_extra_bits[52], thanks
	to Nigel Horne from the ClamAV project.

2004-04-23:  Stuart Caie   <kyzer@4u.net>

	* mspack.h: changed 'this' parameters to 'self' to allow compiling in
	C++ compilers, thanks to Michal Cihar for the suggestion.

	* mspack.h, system.h, mspack.def, winbuild.sh: integrated some changes
	from Petr Blahos to let libmspack build as a Win32 DLL.

	* chmd_fast_find(): added the first part of this code, and comments
	sufficient to finish it :)

2004-04-08  Stuart Caie   <kyzer@4u.net>

	* test/chminfo.c: added a program for dumping useful data from CHM
	files, e.g. index entries and reset tables. I wrote this a while ago
	for investigating a corrupt cabinet, but I never committed it.

2004-03-26  Stuart Caie   <kyzer@4u.net>

	* test/cabd_memory.c: added a new test example which shows an
	mspack_system implementation that reads and writes from memory only,
	no file I/O. Even the source code has a little cab file embedded in it.

2004-03-10  Stuart Caie   <kyzer@4u.net>

	* cabd.c: updated the location of the CAB SDK.

	* cabd.c: changed a couple of MSPACK_ERR_READ errors not based on
	read() failures into MSPACK_ERR_DATAFORMAT errors.

	* mszipd_decompress(): repair mode now aborts after writing a
	repaired block if the error was a hard error (e.g. read error, out
	of blocks, etc)

2004-03-08  Stuart Caie   <kyzer@4u.net>

	* Makefile.am: now builds and installs a versioned library.

	* mszipd.c: completed a new MS-ZIP and inflate implementation.

	* system.c: added mspack_version() and committed to a versioned
	ABI for the library.

	* cabd.c: made mszip repair functionality work correctly.

	* cabd.c: now identifies invalid block headers

	* doc/: API documentation is now included with the library, not
	just on the web.

	* chmd.c: fixed error messages and 64-bit debug output.

	* chmd.c: now also catches NULL files in section 1.

	* test/chmx.c: now acts more like cabextract.

2003-08-29  Stuart Caie   <kyzer@4u.net>

	* ChangeLog: started keeping a ChangeLog :)
