	* test/cabrip.c, test/chminfo.c: add fseeko() support
	
2009-06-01:  Stuart Caie   <kyzer@4u.net>

	* README: clarify the extended license terms

	* doc, Makefile.am: make the doxygen makefile work when using
	an alternate build directory

2006-09-20:  Stuart Caie   <kyzer@4u.net>

	* system.h: I had a choice of adding more to configure.ac to
	test for __func__ and __FUNCTION__, or just removing __FUNCTION__
	from the D() macro. I chose the latter.

	* Makefile.am: Now the --enable-debug in configure will actually
	apply -DDEBUG to the sources.

	* qtmd_decompress(): Fixed a major bug in the QTM decoder, as
	reported by Tomasz Kojm last year. Removed the restriction on
	window sizes as a result. Correctly decodes the XLVIEW cabinets.

2006-08-31:  Stuart Caie   <kyzer@4u.net>

	* lzxd_decompress(): Two major bugs fixed. Firstly, the R0/R1/R2
	local variables weren't set to 1 after lzxd_reset_state().
	Secondly, the LZX decompression stream can sometimes become
	odd-aligned (after an uncompressed block) and the next 16 bit
	fetch needs to be split across two input buffers, ENSURE_BITS()
	didn't cover this case. Many thanks to Igor Glucksmann for
	discovering both these bugs.

2005-06-30:  Stuart Caie   <kyzer@4u.net>

	* cabd_search(): fixed problems with searching files > 4GB for
	cabinets.

2005-06-23:  Stuart Caie   <kyzer@4u.net>

	* qtmd_init(): The QTM decoder is broken for QTM streams with a
	window size less than the frame size. Until this is fixed, fail
	to initialise QTM window sizes less than 15. Thanks to Tomasz Kojm
	for finding the bug.

2005-03-22:  Stuart Caie   <kyzer@4u.net>

	* system.h: now undefs "read", as the latest glibc defines read()
	as a macro which messes everything up. Thanks to Ville Skyttä for
	the update.

2005-03-14:  Stuart Caie   <kyzer@4u.net>

	* test/multifh.c: write an mspack_system implementation that can
	handle normal disk files, open file handles, open file descriptors
	and raw memory all at the same time.

2005-02-24:  Stuart Caie   <kyzer@4u.net>

	* chmd_read_headers(): avoid infinite loop when chmhs1_ChunkSize is
	zero. Thanks to Serge Semashko for the research and discovery.

2005-02-18:  Stuart Caie   <kyzer@4u.net>

	* mspack.h: renamed the "interface" parameter of mspack_version() to
	"entity", as interface is a reserved word in C++. Thanks to Yuriy Z
	for the discovery.

2004-12-09:  Stuart Caie   <kyzer@4u.net>

	* lzss.h, szdd.h, szddd.h: more work on the SZDD/LZSS design.
	
2004-06-12:  Stuart Caie   <kyzer@4u.net>

	* lzxd_static_init(): removed write to lzxd_extra_bits[52], thanks
	to Nigel Horne from the ClamAV project.

2004-04-23:  Stuart Caie   <kyzer@4u.net>

	* mspack.h: changed 'this' parameters to 'self' to allow compiling in
	C++ compilers, thanks to Michal Cihar for the suggestion.

	* mspack.h, system.h, mspack.def, winbuild.sh: integrated some changes
	from Petr Blahos to let libmspack build as a Win32 DLL.

	* chmd_fast_find(): added the first part of this code, and comments
	sufficient to finish it :)

2004-04-08  Stuart Caie   <kyzer@4u.net>

	* test/chminfo.c: added a program for dumping useful data from CHM
	files, e.g. index entries and reset tables. I wrote this a while ago
	for investigating a corrupt cabinet, but I never committed it.

2004-03-26  Stuart Caie   <kyzer@4u.net>

	* test/cabd_memory.c: added a new test example which shows an
	mspack_system implementation that reads and writes from memory only,
	no file I/O. Even the source code has a little cab file embedded in it.

2004-03-10  Stuart Caie   <kyzer@4u.net>

	* cabd.c: updated the location of the CAB SDK.

	* cabd.c: changed a couple of MSPACK_ERR_READ errors not based on
	read() failures into MSPACK_ERR_DATAFORMAT errors.

	* mszipd_decompress(): repair mode now aborts after writing a
	repaired block if the error was a hard error (e.g. read error, out
	of blocks, etc)

2004-03-08  Stuart Caie   <kyzer@4u.net>

	* Makefile.am: now builds and installs a versioned library.

	* mszipd.c: completed a new MS-ZIP and inflate implementation.

	* system.c: added mspack_version() and committed to a versioned
	ABI for the library.

	* cabd.c: made mszip repair functionality work correctly.

	* cabd.c: now identifies invalid block headers

	* doc/: API documentation is now included with the library, not
	just on the web.

	* chmd.c: fixed error messages and 64-bit debug output.

	* chmd.c: now also catches NULL files in section 1.

	* test/chmx.c: now acts more like cabextract.

2003-08-29  Stuart Caie   <kyzer@4u.net>

	* ChangeLog: started keeping a ChangeLog :)
