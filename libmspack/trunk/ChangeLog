	* lzxd_static_init(): removed write to lzxd_extra_bits[52], thanks
	to Nigel Horne from the ClamAV project.

	* mspack.h: changed 'this' parameters to 'self' to allow compiling in
	C++ compilers, thanks to Michal Cihar for the suggestion.

	* mspack.h, system.h, mspack.def, winbuild.sh: integrated some changes
	from Petr Blahos to let libmspack build as a Win32 DLL.

	* chmd_fast_find(): added the first part of this code, and comments
	sufficient to finish it :)

2004-04-08  Stuart Caie   <kyzer@4u.net>

	* test/chminfo.c: added a program for dumping useful data from CHM
	files, e.g. index entries and reset tables. I wrote this a while ago
	for investigating a corrupt cabinet, but I never committed it.

2004-03-26  Stuart Caie   <kyzer@4u.net>

	* test/cabd_memory.c: added a new test example which shows an
	mspack_system implementation that reads and writes from memory only,
	no file I/O. Even the source code has a little cab file embedded in it.

2004-03-10  Stuart Caie   <kyzer@4u.net>

	* cabd.c: updated the location of the CAB SDK.

	* cabd.c: changed a couple of MSPACK_ERR_READ errors not based on
	read() failures into MSPACK_ERR_DATAFORMAT errors.

	* mszipd_decompress(): repair mode now aborts after writing a
	repaired block if the error was a hard error (e.g. read error, out
	of blocks, etc)

2004-03-08  Stuart Caie   <kyzer@4u.net>

	* Makefile.am: now builds and installs a versioned library.

	* mszipd.c: completed a new MS-ZIP and inflate implementation.

	* system.c: added mspack_version() and committed to a versioned
	ABI for the library.

	* cabd.c: made mszip repair functionality work correctly.

	* cabd.c: now identifies invalid block headers

	* doc/: API documentation is now included with the library, not
	just on the web.

	* chmd.c: fixed error messages and 64-bit debug output.

	* chmd.c: now also catches NULL files in section 1.

	* test/chmx.c: now acts more like cabextract.

	* ChangeLog: started keeping a ChangeLog :)
