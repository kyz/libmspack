New in 1.11
* Fixed bug in creating directories given in archives, e.g. extracting file
  "a/b.c" from a cab file wouldn't create directory "a" (broken in 1.10)

New in 1.10
* Multiple -F filters can be given. cabextract will extract files matching
  ANY of the filters
* cabextract now overwrites symlinks by default. This is to be consistent
  with other archive tools. Use the new -k option for the old behaviour of
  keeping symlinks. This does not affect symlinks in the -d dirpath option
* New "-n" option to never overwrite files.
* New "-i" option to interactively prompt if you want to overwrite files

New in 1.9
* Fixed invisible bad extraction when using cabextract -F (broken in 1.8)
* Fixed configure --with-external-libmspack which was broken in 1.8
* configure --with-external-libmspack will now use pkg-config. To configure
  it manually, set environment variables libmspack_CFLAGS and libmspack_LIBS
  before running configure.
* Now includes the test suite (make check)

New in 1.8
* cabextract -f now extracts even more badly damaged files than before

New in 1.7
* cabextract now supports an --encoding parameter, to specify the character
  encoding of CAB filenames if they are not ASCII or UTF8
* cabextract -L now lowercases non-ASCII characters

New in 1.6
* cabextract now prevents archive files giving themselves absolute path access
  using badly UTF-8 encoded slashes.
* Because Cygwin allows both '/' and '\' as path separators, cabextract now
  removes both leading '/'s and '\'s and changes both "../" and "..\" in
  CAB filenames to "xx".  You can no longer have a CAB filename called e.g
  "\/t" (file "t" in the directory "\"). If you need this, create a CAB file
  where the filename is "./\/t" instead.

New in 1.5
* cabextract replaces bad Unicode characters in filenames with the
  standard Unicode replacement character
* wince_rename now puts files under the correct installation path
* Several crashes and hangs were found by Debian project members
  using the afl (American fuzzy lop) tool to generate corrupt
  cabinet files. These crashes and hangs have been fixed.

New in 1.4:
* A bug in the LZX decompressor was fixed.
* cabextract is now more tolerant when processing cabinet sets.
* cabextract is now compatible with even more compilers, and
  now supports 64-bit file I/O on platforms where it's completely
  native, like Mac OS X 10.6 and Fedora x86_64.
* cabextract will no longer print "library not compiled to support
  large files" while reading small files.
* The Windows CE installation format document was improved.

New in 1.3:
* Bugs in the MS-ZIP and Quantum decompressors have been fixed.
* MS-ZIP recovery has been improved.
* cabextract should now compile with MinGW

New in 1.2:
* "-t" option: Allows you to test that every file can be extracted without
  having to extract it. This also prints the MD5 checksum of the file.
* UTF-8 filenames are now decoded correctly.
* Large files (>2GB) are now searched correctly for cabinets.
* Problems with the GNU library code have been fixed.
* Several bugs in the LZX and Quantum decompressors have been fixed.

New in 1.1:
* A security vulnerability has been fixed. If the files within a cabinet
  file include the directory ".." in their filename, this will be changed to
  "xx", to prevent directory traversal by a malicious cabinet (e.g. a cabinet
  with "..\etc\passwd", "..\..\etc\passwd" and so on)
* The GNU library code used has been upgraded to the latest from libiberty,
  so it should now work better with Cygwin.
* cabextract should now compile cleanly on AIX.

New in 1.0:
* The libmspack library is used for all the hard work. You should find
  cabextract more robust, and fractionally faster. See the libmspack website
  at https://www.cabextract.org.uk/libmspack/ for more on this library.
* Fixed a bug (now moved to libmspack) where CAB files that had two kinds of
  compression would crash.
* CAB files should no longer get "/" and "\" mixed up, even with non
  MS-DOS cabinet files created by tools like Powerarchiver and Cablinux.
* Now ignores CAB files listed on the command line that have already been
  used as part of a multipart set. You can now type "cabextract *.cab" on
  your Win95 cabinet set, and cabextract will not extract all the files
  sixty times over.
* Now supports reading and extracting large (more than 2Gb) files.
* "-L" option: viewing the archive pays attention to the "-L" flag, and
  shows the filenames in lowercase.
* "-L" option: cabextract now correctly lowercases cabinet files with
  Unicode filenames.
* "-l" option: viewing the archive should always show forward slashes as
  directory seperators.
* "-F" option: Now you can choose which files are extracted from the cab.
  For example, "cabextract -F '*.wav' music.cab" extracts only WAV files.
* "-s" option: Now you can limit which multipart cabinets are used. For
  example, "cabextract -s WIN98_5*.CAB" will only extract files from
  WIN98_50.CAB through WIN98_59.CAB.
* "-p" option: Now you can extract files to stdout rather than disk.
* Now comes with an experimental "wince_info" and "wince_rename" perl
  scripts in the src/ directory, for examining and processing Windows CE
  installation cabinet header files. There is also the "cabinfo" command
  for examining the structure of a cab file. As this information is not
  very useful to most people, none of these three tools are installed.
* Both the English and Japanese manual page have been updated.
* cabextract now alerts you if you try to unpack InstallShield cabinets.
* The definition of Microsoft cabinet files for UNIX's "magic" file, in
  doc/magic, has been fixed, and a definition of Windows CE install cabinet
  header files has also been added.

New in 0.6:
* Quantum method is now supported! Many thanks to Matthew Russotto for this.
* Fixed more build problems on non-glibc systems. I have now followed the
  'FSF approved' method for including getopt_long, so hopefully Solaris
  and all the other OSes won't have a problem building cabextract any
  more.
* Japanese manual page included -- you will have to install the file
  ja/cabextract.1 by yourself, it's not part of the install process.
* Now searches for spanning cabinet files in a case-insensitive way. It
  also searches in both directions for spanned cabinets (each spanned
  cabinet can include a 'previous' and 'next' cabinet filename), so you
  can also specify a cabinet in the middle of a set and get the full set,
  rather than have to work out what the first cabinet is.
* An off-by-one month error in file dates was fixed.
* Cabinets with files beginning with "/" (or rather, "\") no longer
  extract to your root directory.
* A better embeded cabinet search algorithm was introduced for finding
  those elusive cabinets in files and executables :)
* Now you can find more than one cabinet in a file (if there is
  more than one to find), and it will be extracted or listed as normal.
* Files and directories created now honour your umask settings.
* Errors and warnings are now printed to stderr.

New in 0.5:
* Fixed build problems on non-glibc systems.

New in 0.4:
* Fixed a new bug I added by myself to 0.3... :) It corrupts all MS-ZIP
  compressed cabinets after the first 32k, and it should be very obvious
  that corruption has taken place.
* cabextract should be happier building on Cygwin and other such
  architectures -- you should be able to "./configure; make; make install"
  again. This was broken in 0.3 due to the getopt.c / getopt1.c weirdness
  I copied from GNU hello.
* Now prints 'Finished processing cabinet.' after completing the extraction
  a cabinet.

New in 0.3:
* Fixed very rare, but invisible decrunching bug... if you have any
  important things you extracted with cabextract, extract them again
  to be sure they're not corrupt.
* cabextract now tells you if a file isn't a cabinet file.
* cabextract now goes on to the next file, if extracting one fails.
* cabextract now goes on to the next cabinet, if extracting one fails.
* cabextract lets you try to 'fix' some cabinets by skipping over bad
  blocks rather than failing on them. If you have a corrupt cabinet, try
  the '-f' option, and see how it goes.
* Use the new '-d dir' option to extract cabinets to a given directory.
* Use the new '-L' option to turn the extracted filenames to lowercase.
* Use the new '-q' option to be quiet while extracting archives.
* cabextract now prints more information while it's probing multi-part
  cabinets

New in 0.2:
* new even-easier installation: ./configure; make; make install
* Extracted files now have their timestamps set
* Fixed bug which occured when extracting tiny files 
* Fixed completely invisible intel E8 decoding bug... if you have any
  important things you extracted with cabextract, extract them again
  to be sure they're not corrupt.
* cabinet search extended to look through *any* file for cabinets, not
  just MS-DOS/Windows executables.
* Now looks for multipart cabinets in the same directory as the base cabinet.
  This means you can do stuff like 'cd /tmp && cabextract /cdrom/part01.cab'

New in 0.1:
* supports MSZIP and LZX compression methods
* supports split cabs and cabs embedded in executables
* initial release
