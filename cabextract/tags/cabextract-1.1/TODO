BUG: "cabextract -F file" works but "cabextract -d dir -F file" doesn't,
when file is an exact filename.

Automatic renaming of files in their long form, for Windows CE install
cabs.  This would probably be another program using libmspack, rather than
auto-detected by cabextract.

Decompress files without extraction, and show MD5 of files.

Provide tool for finding OLE2 streams and dumping them. Some InstallShield
Wizard use MS CAB files inside MS OLE2 streams. They look normal, but
every so often, there's a 512 bytes extra here and a 512 bytes missing
there, so the cabinets aren't contiguous.

More advanced repair of corrupted CABs? Possible?

cabjoin - a new program that will read multipart cabinets and output a
single cabinet file containing all parts.

Allow reading a cabinet from stdin.

Allow an exacting list of files to be matched rather than a single pattern
match. Allow more than one pattern match?

cabextract should be localised.
