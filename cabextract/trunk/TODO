Automatic renaming of files in their long form, for Windows CE install
cabs.  This would probably be another program using libmspack, rather than
auto-detected by cabextract.

Decompress files without extraction, and show MD5 of files.

More advanced repair of corrupted CABs? Possible?

cabjoin - a new program that will read multipart cabinets and output a
single cabinet file containing all parts.

Allow reading a cabinet from stdin.

Allow an exacting list of files to be matched rather than a single pattern
match. Allow more than one pattern match?

cabextract should be localised.
