-- NOTE WELL: This version of cabextract is ALPHA software. It does NOT
   support extraction of MSZIP compressed cabinet files. --

Cabinet (.CAB) files are a form of archive, which Microsoft use to
distribute their software, and things like Windows Font Packs. The
cabextract program unpacks these files.

For more information, see http://www.kyz.uklinux.net/cabextract.php3
or run the command 'cabextract --help'.

Example usage:

Extracting files from a cabinet file:
$ cabextract wibble.cab

Extracting files from an executable which contains a cabinet file:
$ cabextract wibble.exe
[cabextract will automatically search executables for embedded cabinets]

Extracting files from a set of cabinet files; wib01.cab, wib02.cab, ...:
$ cabextract wib01.cab
[cabextract will automatically get the names of the other files]

Extracting files to a directory of your choice (in this case, 'boogie'):
$ cabextract -d boogie wibble.cab
[cabextract will create the directory if it does not already exist]

Listing files from a cabinet file:
$ cabextract -l wibble.cab
